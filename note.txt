***** The deatiled description of the folder structureused in the NEXT.js project. *****

1. .next: This folder is automatically generated by Next.js when you run the development server (npm run dev). It contains the optimized build files and assets for your application. You should not manually edit the contents of this folder.

2. app: In version 13, Next.js introduced a new App Router built on `React Server Components`, which supports shared layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more. The App Router works in a new directory named `app`. The `app` directory works alongside the `pages` directory to allow for incremental adoption. This allows you to opt some routes of your application into the new behavior while keeping other routes in the `pages` directory for previous behavior. The App Router takes priority over the Pages Router. Routes across directories should not resolve to the same URL path and will cause a build-time error to prevent a conflict. By default, components inside `app` are `React Server Components`. This is a performance optimization and allows you to easily adopt them, and we can also use Client Components.
        Next.js uses a file-system based router where:
            * Folders are used to define routes. A route is a single path of nested folders, following the file-system hierarchy from the root folder down to a final leaf folder that includes a `page.js`
            * Files are used to create UI that is shown for a route segment.

        To create a nested route, we can nest folders inside each other. For example, we can add a new `/dashboard/settings` route by nesting two new folders in the app directory. The `/dashboard/settings` route is composed of three segments:
            * / (Root segment)
            * dashboard (Segment)
            * settings (Leaf segment)

        The React components defined in special files of a route segment are rendered in a specific hierarchy:
            * layout.js : A layout is UI that is shared between multiple pages. On navigation, layouts preserve state, remain interactive, and do not re-render. Layouts can also be nested
            * error.js (React error boundary) : The error.js file convention allows you to gracefully handle unexpected runtime errors in nested routes.
                -> Automatically wrap a route segment and its nested children in a React Error Boundary.
                -> Create error UI tailored to specific segments using the file-system hierarchy to adjust granularity.
                -> Isolate errors to affected segments while keeping the rest of the application functional.
                -> Add functionality to attempt to recover from an error without a full page reload.
            * loading.js (React suspense boundary): The special file loading.js helps you create meaningful Loading UI with React Suspense. With this convention, you can show an instant loading state from the server while the content of a route segment loads. The new content is automatically swapped in once rendering is complete.
            * not-found.js (React error boundary): The not-found file is used to render UI when the notFound function is thrown within a route segment. Along with serving a custom UI, Next.js will also return a 404 HTTP status code. In addition to catching expected notFound() errors, the root app/not-found.js file also handles any unmatched URLs for your whole application. This means users that visit a URL that is not handled by your app will be shown the UI exported by the app/not-found.js file.

3. node_modules: This folder is created by npm and contains all the installed dependencies required for your project. These dependencies are listed in the `package.json` file.

4. public: This folder is used to store static assets like images, fonts, and other files that you want to be served directly to the client without going through the Next.js server. For example, you can put an image in `public/images` and reference it as `/images/image.jpg` in your components.

5. gitignore: The `.gitignore` file is a plain text file used to specify which files and directories should be excluded from version control when using Git, a distributed version control system. By default, Git tracks all files in your project's directory unless they are specifically ignored using this file.

6. jsconfig.json: The `jsconfig.json file` is a configuration file used in JavaScript projects to provide settings and options for the JavaScript language features and module resolution used within the project. It is typically used in projects that use ECMAScript modules (ES modules) and want to configure how JavaScript files are resolved and treated within the project.

7. next.config.js: The `next.config.js` file is a configuration file used in `Next.js` projects to customize the behavior and settings of the `Next.js` framework. It allows developers to extend and override the default configuration provided by `Next.js`, enabling them to tailor the project to their specific needs. The `next.config.js` file should be placed in the root directory of your `Next.js` project. When you create this file, `Next.js` will automatically detect and use the configurations defined within it.

8. package-lock.json: The `package-lock.json` file is a manifest file used in `Node.js` projects to lock down the versions of the installed dependencies. It works in conjunction with the package.json file and provides more determinism in the dependency tree, ensuring that every developer or build system installing the dependencies gets the exact same versions. This is important because Node.js packages can have dependencies of their own, and different versions of these dependencies could lead to compatibility issues or unexpected behavior in the application.

9. package.json: The package.json file is a crucial file used in Node.js projects to define essential information about the project, manage dependencies, and specify various configurations and scripts. It serves as a manifest for the project, allowing developers and build systems to understand project details and automate various tasks.

10. postcss.config.js: The `postcss.config.js` file is a configuration file used in projects that utilize PostCSS, a tool that enables you to transform CSS with JavaScript. PostCSS plugins can be applied to CSS files to add or modify CSS features, perform optimizations, or support future CSS syntax that may not be natively supported by all browsers. The postcss.config.js file allows you to specify which PostCSS plugins to use and configure their options. When you run PostCSS on your CSS files, it will read this configuration file and apply the specified plugins in the specified order.

11. tailwind.config.js: The `tailwind.config.js` file is a configuration file used in projects that utilize Tailwind CSS, a popular utility-first CSS framework. This file allows you to customize and extend Tailwind CSS according to your project's specific design and styling requirements. When you create a `tailwind.config.js` file in your project, Tailwind CSS will automatically detect and use the configurations defined within it. By modifying this file, you can customize colors, fonts, spacing, breakpoints, and more, making Tailwind CSS adapt to your project's unique design system.
